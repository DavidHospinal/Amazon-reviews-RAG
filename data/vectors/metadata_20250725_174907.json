I have read it over and over again, since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before I left for Berkeley to attend law school.  I have given copies to many friends, and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully.There is enormous wisdom in each chapter, especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live - which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings.  Gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of Life, and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century.This book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what Life is really all about.  Indeed, it can be picked up at any age, and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written.I urge anyone, who is thinking about buying it, to do so.

Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. \"It Must be a cult,\" he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and ch | Categoría: Books | Calificación: 5.0/5",

But when you first open to those sections that apply to you, and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears, well, shock is the only word for it. Yes, the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in 'The Prophet' may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned, but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed, unique. I've purchased countless copies to the ones that I know will love and understand his words. And if for nothing else, Kahlil's work can be labeled as truly, a literary work of art. | Categoría: Books | Calificación: 5.0/5",

I started reading it shortly afterward and honestly had to stop for a little while because I tried consuming too much (sorry, my normal is history, historical fiction, and either sci-fi or fantasy); after all, this is poetry and philosophy and should be consumed like a fine wine or excellent scotch, slowly savoring the flavor.  Having let things slip a little longer than intended I started reading it again, this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing  the impact on me.  This time things flowed somewhat better for me.  The individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone.  While I don't always agree with Mr. Gibran philosophy for a subject, some are particularly moving; for me in particular his passage on Joy and Sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two, describing to me  | Categoría: Books | Calificación: 4.0/5",

I am proud to include it in my collection.  Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.

I mentioned a quote from this book to a friend once who told me that her mother in law gave her the book years ago, and she had never read it.

To clarify, it is not as good as an FF game, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun.The story is pretty linear, the characters are well developed, and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES (which was produced by Squaresoft, not Capcom). The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners. And while the graphics are not on par with Final Fantasy IX or Chrono Cross, this is still a great looking game.Try it. I think you will like it. | Categoría: Video_Games | Calificación: 4.0/5",

Since I use them on my Wii now, it is much more hazardous for my Wii if someone trips over the short cables. This was a perfect solution to my problems. So far I haven't had any problems with them and they allow me and my friends to not sit 6 ft away from the Wii. Another great thing about these is that you can plug them end on end to make a longer cable. | Categoría: Video_Games | Calificación: 5.0/5",

Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long. | Categoría: Video_Games | Calificación: 4.0/5",

It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well, it was hard to locate where you were going, unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.

The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2, tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation. | Categoría: Video_Games | Calificación: 4.0/5",

I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade. | Categoría: Video_Games | Calificación: 4.0/5",

There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel.

I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.  Fun doesn't begin to describe it. | Categoría: Video_Games | Calificación: 5.0/5",

Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you wont be disappointed. | Categoría: Video_Games | Calificación: 2.0/5",

In any normal world, this would be a one star game.Except somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked.Certainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is  | Categoría: Video_Games | Calificación: 3.0/5",

Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.

His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies. | Categoría: Movies_and_TV | Calificación: 5.0/5",

The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau.The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about, but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts, though, were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way, it was very good.If you choose to watch this movie, you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-)The movie is a solid PG movie. | Categoría: Movies_and_TV | Calificación: 4.0/5",

I remember having seen this on TV but viewing it again now on DVD made me realize that I'd forgotten about how downright mean and cold-hearted Henry Winkler's character, Benedict Slade, really is!!!  Politically-correct viewing in the 21st Century has really insulated from harsh emotions such as those portrayed by Mr. Winkler.  The production has that 70's look to it but it is well done and the actors and actresses all bring an unpolished genuine-ness to their parts.  Being a fan of \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens, I am pleased to have this rendition alongside other classic versions as well as the 1984 IBM production. | Categoría: Movies_and_TV | Calificación: 5.0/5",

They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role. But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought  | Categoría: Movies_and_TV | Calificación: 5.0/5",

I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in, but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called \"must have Christmas movies\" then pass it up for another title. | Categoría: Movies_and_TV | Calificación: 3.0/5",

Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, | Categoría: Movies_and_TV | Calificación: 3.0/5",

It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way.This film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph. The production is superb and settings are excellent. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well. Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph. Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers. The supporting cast was fantastic.Although I have read the story of Joseph, this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done.The only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion.

If you want the best family version, go with the Muppet Christmas Carol, which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good. But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special \"jump start\" this year.  In short, this movie deserves your family's full attention in the coming Christmas season.

Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.

    "combined_text": "Resumen: Basics Are Covered....Beautiful Book | Reseña: I absolutely love this book! Before purchasing, I found myself gathering bits and pieces of information from the wilton site to make the flowers and borders that I wanted, but this book puts them all together neatly without leaving anything out. I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful, but so much of it is advanced, and I'm just not there. I only decorate for fun. This book sticks to basics which, for me, is essential to focus. If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious. Then I end up giving up. So, with this book I can actually follow the process and learn step by step without the frustration.The only small disappointment was the weight of the cover. The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well. Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though, so no big deal. | Categoría: Home_and_Kitchen | Calificación: 5.0/5",

Since all you see on the cover is some \"clown\" cupcakes using the silly-feet baking cups (which I also purchased) I was expecting more uses of the silly-feet (I counted five), but it really covers whimsical cupcakes of all sorts, many of which would be suitable to make with children (easy to make).It's really just an idea book and a catalog of Wilton products and what you can do with them. There is a helpful section called \"The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate\", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the \"it wasn't what I expected\" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas. If y | Categoría: Home_and_Kitchen | Calificación: 4.0/5",

It is ideal for smaller books and for those readers who don't need variety of reading angles. However, it can accommodate larger books as long as you are a bit careful how you use it. In addition to books, it works really well with a variety of electronic book readers and the new generation of tablet computers. I've used it with myKindle Wireless Reading Device (6\" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)and iPad. In fact, when I was looking for an inexpensive way of propping up my iPad so that it doesn't lay flat on the table I settled for this option and so far it is working perfectly for me. In fact, I am writing this review on iPad that is propped up with it.The only problem that I have with it is the manufacturing quality. The first holder that I bought broke after a few months of use.

It's a lot of fun but, I admit, a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps, my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.

It is fairly lightweight, quiet for a circular saw, zipped right through a bunch of cedar planks and cedar 4x4s once I got the hang of it.  (Note that I used aFreud D0740X Diablo 7-1/4 40 Tooth ATB Finishing Saw Bladefor these cuts.)  I'm not sure yet whether the adjustable handle is a must-have feature, but it is a nice option to have.  And adjusting the cutting depth and angle is a cinch.After using this for a full day I think the electric brake and replaceable power cord on the Milwaukee 6394-21 would be a nice upgrade - but perhaps not worth the significant extra cost for my DIY use.  My only other concern is the aluminum base plate, which flexes a bit under pressure.  If Milwaukee had included a stiff magnesium base plate this would be a 5-star saw.  As is, it is still a great bargain - the only other saw I considered (a Makita with magnesium base plate) was $35 more at the local big box store. | Categoría: Tools_and_Home_Improvement | Calificación: 4.0/5",

I don't particularly like the style of the furniture but if you have your own style I'm sure you can innovate beyond these plans.  One picky point I have is that there is one dining room hutch/cabinet in this book that has and angled face and cabinets, but the book skips right over the steps required to cut the angle in the face frames after they are built so that they mate together at an angle and create the beveled face of the cabinet. One thing you have to be careful with when using pocket hole screws is that if you want to plane or trim an assembled face frame or panel, you don't want to run a screw through your blades - they are hidden within and you have to remember where they are locate | Categoría: Tools_and_Home_Improvement | Calificación: 4.0/5",

A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem, but not its other fault, difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place. | Categoría: Tools_and_Home_Improvement | Calificación: 5.0/5",

Lo and behold, after reading an Amazon review I learned that you could buy an optional sub-base with a larger whole that would accommodate larger bits. I needed to round the edge of a 1\" piece of oak, and the rounding bit has a \"shoulder\" that needed to be above the work surface. So the larger hole in the sub-base enabled me to raise the bit so that only the curved portion engaged the wood. Evidently the thinking behind the smaller hole is to make the router more stable for hand-held use, but I found it no problem to work with the larger hole. I totally agree with whoever said that this base should come standard with the router - with as much as router tables cost, you need this flexibility to maximize what you can do in the hand-held mode. | Categoría: Tools_and_Home_Improvement | Calificación: 4.0/5",

    "combined_text": "Resumen: What A Pleasant Surprise | Reseña: To be honest, even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years, I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers, the last thing I need was another router, so instead, I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable, very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base, it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes, to a predetermined depth with each pass, simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal.  I love it. | Categoría: Tools_and_Home_Improvement | Calificación: 5.0/5",

First, disconnect from the power source [the wall outlet].... get a pair of pliers, and crack open the old switch, as if you were cracking open a walnut....... remove the old switch, and replace with the new one!Simple as that. If you've never tried it before, than, HEY!! ...here's a new adventure waiting for you. You won't even need to cut any wires, as the original cut wire will be attached to the new switch in a similar fashion. If you're uncertain, than crack it open, and check it out before buying that new switch.The whole job should take no more than 15-20 min max!! | Categoría: Tools_and_Home_Improvement | Calificación: 3.0/5",

Then when the newer lamp blew a bulb I decided to get a set of these bulbs to see if it would work again.

So I decided to try one these bulbs in my old (presumed dead) desk lamp. After carefully installing the new bulb my old lamp was back to life.

Target still offered a variation of the lamp I'd bought before, but for triple the price of this similar LED lamp from Ikea.I particularly like the compact light housing on the Ikea lamp, and the heavy base that ensures the light stays where I aim it. My only complaint is that the power switch is in the power cord rather than a toggle switch on the base as it is on the Target lamps. The light output is also a bit less, but I consider that an advantage for reading in bed.My wife doesn't like the look of the Ikea lamp, but I really do like it, so form your own opinion from the photos.Recommended. | Categoría: Tools_and_Home_Improvement | Calificación: 4.0/5",

The P/C kit comes in a cheap & fragile hard plastic case that must have cost all of ten cents to make and the components are held in place with inexpensive cardboard separators.  In addition, after a dozen years or so, every component in my set had corroded terribly -- the metal looked similar to very old aluminum storm windows, pits and all. It's not clear why this happened, since they've never been outside the basement workshop, and no other tools corroded.  The corrosion caused significant resistance when screwing on the lock-nuts. Steel wool reduced the roughness of the corrosion, but the pieces still look dreadful.The three largest guides in the P/C set are too long for numerous dovetail jigs, such as the Leigh jig.

Even with the screws firmly affixed, there is still a small amount of play between the guide and the router. This does not inspire confidence, and creates accuracy problems when using the guide fully extended. There's really no excuse for this, it's just poor QA. While you might expect some play from generic stuff, a brand-new Porter-Cable brand attachment ought to fit a brand-new Porter-Cable router snugly.

Brakes are a definate plus, for you don't want to slow down when you're on a roll and they make for a downright safer cut.  Also consider the $60 Skil 13amp saw with a laser.  Skil is a great name when it comes to circular saws, and what a great price.  If you want to spend more look at the Skil worm drive saw.

It does an excellent job of catching dust from the 1-inch fitting on many of my Porter Cable tools.  I had used a Porter Cable sander with one at a friends, and was so impressed with how much better it caught the dust than my sander, I bought a new Porter Cable sander, that came with the hose, and sold my old sander on ebay.I had a \"Mr. Nozzle\" hose on my shop vac when I bought my sander, and the Porter Cable hose hooked up to it with no problems.  (The \"Mr. Nozzle\" hose is a lot better than the standard hose that comes with the shop vacuums, and is well worth the money it costs.  It flexes better, and is a lot more durable.)I have since been influenced in my tool purchases by whether they have good dust capture capabilities, and as a consequence have several more sanders that hook up to the 1-inch hose, two Porter Cable Saws, a biscut joiner, and several routers I use it with.I am satisfied enough that I am ordering another today, becau | Categoría: Tools_and_Home_Improvement | Calificación: 5.0/5",

Having the ability to change the angle of the handle is nice, especially when making long rip cuts at a shallow depth.The saw has a tremendous amount of power and has so far, cut through everything I have thrown at it.  3/4 plywood is easily ripped cleanly and accurately.  2x lumber can be mitered as well.  The supplied blade isn't bad either considering it is thrown in by the maunfacturer.  Eventually, I will upgrade it to one of the better quality Freud blades.As with most Milwaukee tools, the warranty is stout.

It's easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.

I have always lived a conservative life, recycled (still do), and so on. And not because some celebrity told me I should or whatever, but because it just makes sense to do so. So with that out of the way, onto the actual product.When gas prices peaked last summer we stopped using our lawn tractor because it used just too much gas (and it didn't cut the grass all that well to begin with) and just used our self propelled Honda mower. Well after the tractor sat all summer we decided to just sell it and buy a reel mower and so far it has more then paid for itself.The first question EVERYONE asks is, is it hard to push? Plain and simple, NO. These new reel mowers are lighter and are better designed so they are much easier to push then the old Leave It To Beaver style reel mowers.

Keep the transparent lid on until the seeds have mostly sprouted, then remove the lid and slowly \"harden off\" the plants by exposing them to the outdoors and eventually sunlight over time.I wish I'd ordered two or more of these. It's much, much cheaper to start flowers from seed on your own versus buying them at the local Home Depot or nursery. I already ordered more impatiens and I have some vincas I want to get started for the warmer months. Buy some decent potting mix or seed starting mix, or if you're really crunchy granola run some garden soil through your oven @ about 350 degrees for an hour to sterilize it.

It is ideal if you have a small lawn or want to get a little exercise while mowing. The downside to any push mower is that apparently they require a special skill set to sharpen the blades & most garden shops do not sharpen the blades.  I was able to find one place that sharpens blades in the entire area and it is not cheap. It's not a good idea to do it yourself, quite dangerous, & dull blades are useless. The blades seemed to dull very quickly, if that is possible - maybe they weren't very sharp to begin with. I hope more people will buy push mowers, which will force more shops to consider getting the tools so they can offer sharpening. I have 4 friends who all have the same problem. This has nothing to do with the mower itself, just know that before you buy it, research your area to make sure there is someone who can sharpen it for you. | Categoría: Patio_Lawn_and_Garden | Calificación: 3.0/5",

I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $30, but then I decided to just get a new one.  There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model.  The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.The older model had a &#34;swing open&#34; cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  Th | Categoría: Patio_Lawn_and_Garden | Calificación: 5.0/5",

Now, you can't exactly put up deer fencing -- at least not attractively-- at the front of your lawn, but you can protect your plants, it turns out, with this netting.What I did was cut the netting into small swaths which I lay over the plants.

The bats were picking off the bugs that were attracted by the bug zapper!  How cool is that?!?  I am such a city kid that I made myself a cup of hot cocoa and sat by the back door with the porch light on, just watching the bats go back and forth.  Since that evening, I've seen the bats almost every time I happen to go outside late at night, so I guess my bug zapper is doing well to keep our local bats fat and happy.

I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.

The material, however, is too flimsy and if the cat (or any other large animal) really wanted to get into the beds, it wouldn't have too much trouble cutting through the netting with its claws.  So I had to pursue a different path to keep the cats out.I did, however, keep using this material to keep birds and other unwanted pests (moths, butterflies, etc.) out of my garden.  Having another pair of hands around to help with installation is good because this material tangles easily and snags on just about everything, including itself.  So you need to exercise care when putting it on otherwise it will rip.  I also realized after a few months of use that the mesh size is too large so moths and butterflies can easily squeeze themselves through the netting and make their way to the plants.For the price, it's a decent product.

I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away, it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled, before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing, what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit, but I don't want to kill songbirds, certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away, not kill them. | Categoría: Patio_Lawn_and_Garden | Calificación: 3.0/5",

Bug zappers like this use UV light; it's been proven time and again that mosquitos have 0% attraction to UV light!  Oh, sure, the octenol attracts SOME types (not all) mosquitos, but the way this device is designed, the octenol cartridge hangs on the BOTTOM of the unit, away from the electric grid.  Mosquitos that are attracted have absolutely no reason to go inside the grid, because once again, they are NOT attracted to UV!All this device will do is kill a bunch of UV-attracted bugs, such as moths and mostly harmless aquatic-type insects that would NEVER have come near your home anyway if you didn't have a bright UV bulb shining in their faces.  Oh sure, by statistical chance, you'll kill a few mosquitos just by chance one flies in there by random but we're talking about less than 5% of the mosquito population will do that.  5% erradication i | Categoría: Patio_Lawn_and_Garden | Calificación: 3.0/5",

Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide, and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces. | Categoría: Patio_Lawn_and_Garden | Calificación: 5.0/5",

It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a &#34;traveling&#34; sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a | Categoría: Patio_Lawn_and_Garden | Calificación: 4.0/5",
